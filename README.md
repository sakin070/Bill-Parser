SEG4910 - Capstone Project
Project: Fetching Energy Bills Data from Files 
Team size: 2-3 members
The goal of this project is developing a feature to extract energy data from different types of data files and import them into a database. 
The project consists of two parts:

The focus of the first part is on extracting energy data from PDF and image files. Different countries and even different cities within the same country have their energy bills in a different design and format. Students will be provided with at least four different bill templates for the implementation of this part.

The second part provides a challenge to extract data from external systems that does not support any type of APIs. For example, to display the energy bill of this month from system X, you need to provide the customer number and bill number. These two pieces of information will be entered in the ASHYA Energy system and, in the background, the system will pass the data to the user interface of system X, and scan the page to retrieve the energy data and import them into a database.
