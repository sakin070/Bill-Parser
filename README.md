SEG4910 - Capstone Project
Project: Fetching Energy Bills Data from Files Team size: 2-3 members
The goal of this project is developing a feature to extract energy data from different types of data files and import them into a database. The project consists of two parts:
The focus of the first part is on extracting energy data from PDF and image files. Different countries and even different cities within the same country have their energy bills in a different design and format. Students will be provided with at least four different bill templates for the implementation of this part.
